# ***HAY POINTS - 10295***

You are to implement a simplified Hay Point system. You will be given a Hay Point dictionary and<br>
a number of job descriptions. For each job description you are to compute the salary associated with<br>
the job, according to the system.<br>

Input<br>

The first line of input contains 2 positive integers: m ≤ 1000, the number of words in the Hay Point<br>
dictionary, and n ≤ 100, the number of job descriptions. m lines follow; each contains a word (a string<br>
of up to 16 lower-case letters) and a dollar value (a real number between 0 and 1,000,000). Following<br>
the dictionary are the n job descriptions. Each job description consists of one or more lines of text<br>
and end with a line with a '.'.<br>

Output<br>

For each job description, output the corresponding salary computed as the sum of the Hay Point values<br>
for all words that appear in the description. Words that do not appear in the dictionary have a value<br>
of ‘0’.<br>
