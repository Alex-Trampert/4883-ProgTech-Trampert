# ***FOOTBALL (aka SOCCER) - P10194***

Football the most popular sport in the world (americans insist to call it “Soccer”, but we will call<br>
it “Football”). As everyone knows, Brasil is the country that have most World Cup titles (four of<br>
them: 1958, 1962, 1970 and 1994). As our national tournament have many teams (and even regional<br>
tournaments have many teams also) it’s a very hard task to keep track of standings with so many teams<br>
and games played!<br>
So, your task is quite simple: write a program that receives the tournament name, team names and<br>
games played and outputs the tournament standings so far<br>
