# ***TRAFFIC LIGHTS - 161***

One way of achieving a smooth and economical drive to work is to *catch every traffic light*, that is<br>
have every signal change to green as you approach it. One day you notice as you come over the brow of<br>
a hill that every traffic light you can see has just changed to green and that therefore your chances of<br>
catching every signal is slight. As you wait at a red light you begin to wonder *how long it will be before<br>
all the lights again show green*, not necessarily all turn green, *merely all show green simultaneously*,<br>
even if it is only for a second.
