# ***PLACE THE GUARDS - 11080***

A guard in a junction can guard *all the junctions and streets<br> 
adjacent to it*. But the guards themselves are not gentle. If a<br>
street is guarded by *multiple guards* then they start fighting.<br>
So the king *does not want the scenario where a street may be<br> 
guarded by two guards*. Given the information about the<br> 
streets and junctions of Ajabdesh, help the king to find the<br> 
*minimum number of guards needed to guard all the junctions<br> 
and streets* of his country.<br>

Soooo, this one was a little weird. In uDebug, I am getting correct output for every set of inputs...<br>
***HOWEVER***<br>
When I submit to the online judge website, it says wrong answer. I used my own method of<br>
tracking the data and checking connections - long story short - checking whether the<br>
graph is bipartite - as well as storing connections.
