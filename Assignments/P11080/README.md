# ***PLACE THE GUARDS - 11080***

A guard in a junction can guard *all the junctions and streets<br> 
adjacent to it*. But the guards themselves are not gentle. If a<br>
street is guarded by *multiple guards* then they start fighting.<br>
So the king *does not want the scenario where a street may be<br> 
guarded by two guards*. Given the information about the<br> 
streets and junctions of Ajabdesh, help the king to find the<br> 
*minimum number of guards needed to guard all the junctions<br> 
and streets* of his country.<br>
