### **Input**<br>
The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers<br>
denote the value of v (−100 ≤ v ≤ 100) and t (0 ≤ t ≤ 200) (t means at the time the particle gains<br>
that velocity) <br>
### **Output**<br>
For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.<br>
