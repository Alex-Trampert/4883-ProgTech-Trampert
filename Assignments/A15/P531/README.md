# ***COMPROMISE - 531***

### **Input**<br>
The input file will contain several test cases.<br>
Each test case consists of two texts. Each text is given as a sequence of lower-case words, separated<br>
by whitespace, but with no punctuation. Words will be less than 30 characters long. Both texts will<br>
contain less than 100 words and there will be at least one common word in each text. Each text will<br>
be terminated by a line containing a single ‘#’.<br>
Input is terminated by end of file.<br>

### **Output**<br>
For each test case, print the longest common subsequence of words occuring in the two texts. If there<br>
is more than one such sequence, any one is acceptable. Separate the words by one blank. After the last<br>
word, output a newline character.<br>
