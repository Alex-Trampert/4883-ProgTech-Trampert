# ***JOLLY JUMPERS - 10038***

A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the *absolute values of the difference* between<br>
successive elements take on *all the values 1 through n âˆ’ 1*. For instance,<br>

1 4 2 3

is a jolly jumper, because the *absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1 respectively*. The definition implies
that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. You are to write a program to determine whether
or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.
