# ***HARDWOOD SPECIES - 10226***

You are to compute the total fraction of the tree population<br>
represented by each species. Each test case of your program<br>
consists of a list of the species of every tree observed by the<br> 
satellite; one tree per line. For each test case print the name<br> 
of each species represented in the population, in alphabetical order,<br>
followed by the percentage of the population it represents, to 4<br>
decimal places.<br>

 AGAIN... A LITTLE WEIRD... In uDebug, I am getting correct output for every set of inputs...<br>
***HOWEVER***<br>
When I submit to the online judge website, it says time limit exceeded. The program runs<br>
perfectly in replit almost immediately, and I'm not sure what loop the website is getting<br>
stuck in. I'm not even sure where to start to try to fix the problem.
