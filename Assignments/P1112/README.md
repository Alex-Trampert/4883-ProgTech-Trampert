# ***MICE AND MAZE - 1112***

### ***Input***<br>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases<br>
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a<br>
blank line between two consecutive inputs.<br>
The maze cells are numbered 1, 2, . . . , N, where N is the total number of cells. You can assume<br>
that N ≤ 100.<br>
The first three input lines contain N, the number of cells in the maze, E, the number of the exit<br>
cell, and the starting value T for the count-down timer (in some arbitrary time unit).<br>
The fourth line contains the number M of connections in the maze, and is followed by M lines, each<br>
specifying a connection with three integer numbers: two cell numbers a and b (in the range 1, . . . , N)<br>
and the number of time units it takes to travel from a to b.<br>
Notice that each connection is one-way, i.e., the mice can’t travel from b to a unless there is another<br>
line specifying that passage. Notice also that the time required to travel in each direction might be<br>
different.<br>

### ***Output***<br>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.<br> 
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.<br>
The output consists of a single line with the number of mice that reached<br>
the exit cell E in at most T time units.<br>
