# ***BRICK WALL PATTERNS - 900***

If we want to build a brick wall out of the usual size<br>
of brick which has a length twice as long as its height,<br>
and if our wall is to be two units tall, we can make our<br>
wall in a number of patterns, depending on how long<br>
we want it.<br>

Long story short - uses the fibonacci sequence to find desired output!<br>
