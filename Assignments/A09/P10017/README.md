# ***NEVER ENDING TOWERS OF HANOI - 10017***

### ***Input***
The input file will consist of a series of lines. Each line will contain two integers n, m. n,<br>
lying within the range [1, 250], will denote the number of disks and m, belonging to [0, 2n − 1],<br> 
will be the number of the last move, you may assume that m will also be less than 216, and<br>
you may also assume that a good algorithm will always have enough time. The file will end at a<br>
line formed by two zeros.<br>

### ***Output***
The output will consist again of a series of lines, formatted as show below.<br>
NOTES:<br>
• There are 3 spaces between de ‘=>’ and the first number printed.<br> 
  If there isn’t any number, there should be no spaces.<br>
• All the disks in a single peg are printed in a single line (not as in the Problem #1 below).<br>
• Print a blank line after every problem.<br>
