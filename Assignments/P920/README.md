# ***SUNNY MOUNTAINS - 920***

Each test case starts with a line containing the number N of coordinate pairs. The remaining N<br>
lines for each test case contain the coordinates defining the landscape. Each of these lines contains two<br>
integers, x and y, separated by a single space. The first integer, x, is the X-coordinate, and the second,<br>
y, is the Y-coordinate of the considered point.<br>

Each output line contains a single real number with exactly two decimal digits. <br>
This number represents the length in meters of the sunny<br>
mountainsides for the corresponding test case.<br>
