	Count Sort was almost always superior when sorting integers. Quick sort only beat it when there was such a small amount of items. Quick sort was also very poor unless there was a very large amount of data, or a very small amount. Radix and Heap were always similar.

	Count Sort was almost always superior when sorting floats as well. Quick sort only beat it when there was such a small amount of items. Quick sort was also very poor unless there was a very large amount of data, or a very small amount. Count performed well, regardless. Radix and heap were always similar.
Was having trouble getting strings to work properly. But I assume they will follow the above patterns as integers were VERY identical to floats.
